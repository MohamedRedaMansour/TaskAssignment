# link_assignment
Greetings ,
I was very busy this week and I began working on this task today 7 pm ,this is almost a 4 hours work so it's not complete..
first I created a newtwork layer :
  - using Dio with only one instance accross the entire app (apiClient)
  - Switch case on the request type(Post & Get ) ; the most common api requests type 
  - abstract class GetResponse to handel Api response
  - adding a logging interceptor 
  
secondly I created binding file for dependency injection(for futher use e.g GetX)
then - I made the UI in pages directory

in The UI directory :
in MainPage
- there is UI screen 
- there is a model for api response
- there is viewModel for each screen

However : I passed the model with the constructor to details screen

I had no time left before deadline so I stopped Here ,
what's missing:::
- use components UI
- use MainContainer as a container for all pages with the appBar & Drawer fixed , only inner screens changes

in all Cases I will complete this task tomorrow.
Thank you
